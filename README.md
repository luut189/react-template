# Website Template in React | Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Additionally, this setup also includes TailwindCSS and Prettier.

## Usage

Clone this repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luut189/react-template.git
cd react-template
```

Change the `name` inside the `package.json` to your actual project name.

And then, to install all dependencies, make sure you have **Nodejs** installed and use:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, to start the dev server, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And start to edit at `./src/App.tsx`
